    "the capital of India, has a rich history.The city is dotted with spellbinding mosques, forts, and monuments left over from the Mughal rulers that once occupied the city.

Also called the Pink City, the capital of the royal state of Rajasthan, was ruled by the Rajputs for many centuries and developed as a planned city in the 17th century AD.
